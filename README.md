EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is a way of visualizing, summarizing and interpreting
the information that is hidden in rows and column format1. EDA is necessary for Machine Learning because 
it helps to understand the data, find patterns and trends, check assumptions and choose appropriate models1234.

Some examples of EDA techniques are:
1.Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
2. Data cleaning: handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, etc.
3. Data transformation: scaling, normalization, encoding, etc.
4. Data visualization: histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, etc.
